# bitwarden-1password
Create 1Password .1pif file from Bitwarden JSON file.

Only adapted to my needs. Works for logins and notes. Not for cards.

Run console app. Specify folder and specify JSON file to convert. The 1pif file will be saved in the specified folder.

The 1pif file can be imported with the 1Password Windows app (not on the web).
